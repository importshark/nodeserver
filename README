This project is old, and not very good. If you want to make a web server, use something like express.js, not the way I did it. This project was just for testing purposes.

This is the latest working release of my node web server.

To setup:

1. Download the zip folder and extract contents.
2. Make sure node is installed (nodejs.org)
Use command prompt to run "node boot.js"
it should display that a node server is running and where to find it in your browser.
